# Abbrase

Abbrase is an abbreviated passphrase generator. An abbrase is one of the passwords it produces. It generates a password and a phrase like "phyeigdolrejutt" and "physical eight dollars rejected utterly".

Creating secure passwords is easy. Remembering them is hard. [Pwgen](http://sourceforge.net/projects/pwgen/) makes them memorable though prounouncability. XKCD [suggests](http://xkcd.com/936/) using a series of random common words, but memorizing series of unrelated words can be difficult, and typing long phrases can be tedious.

Abbrase is an experiment in generating probable phrases using markov chains, and abbreviating each word to the first few letters. This strikes a balance between excessive password length and excessive mnemonic length. Passwords generated by Abbrase are as secure as a number with the same length. "122079103" and "toldulbal" (tolerably dull ball) are equally hard to attack.

The wordlist and bigram graph are generated with data from Google NGrams [dataset](http://storage.googleapis.com/books/ngrams/books/datasetsv2.html), used under the [Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/).

## Theory

Language is the most information-dense thing people memorize. Brains don't operate on bits.

Pi recitation record-holders don't have thousands of digits in their minds. They map clusters of digits to far more mentally palatable words, memorizing a long story instead of a sequence of digits.

Memorizing a grammatically-sensible sentence fragment is easier than a sequence of randomly chosen words.

Picking a favorite phrase from the ones generated by Abbrase could make them very slightly easier to attack. A sophisticated attacker could check passwords that are likely to be picked before others. If the attacker can perfectly model which passwords you would prefer, this reduces the security of your password in a proportional amount to the number of passwords you selected it from -- if you picked from 32 passwords generated by abbrase, it makes your password 32x easier to attack (5 bits of security lost).

## Building

    git clone https://github.com/rmmh/abbrase.git
    cd abbrase
    make
    ./abbrase

The abbrase executable can optionally be supplied with `length` (a number), `count` (a number), and `hook` (a word).

## FAQ

*Q:* Isn't using a phrase more secure than abbreviating it?

*A:* Not at all for phrases Abbrase generates. Displayed phrases are generated deterministically from the password, so they have no added security. Otherwise yes, 4 words have more security than 4 abbreviated words, but they're less convenient to type, and the added characters aren't as valuable as the first few characters.
